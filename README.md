### Summary
This was a minimal project made to use javaScript to create a message lyric generator program. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to execute my project and the project does not hold a lot of options for the location, people and drinks.
What it does show how to use objects as Key-value pairs and uses concise body arrow functions to execute code to make the values become random on the page.
